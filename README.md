## FAQ

### Will new contents in 1.21.1 be updated in 1.20.1?

No. 1.20.1 now only receive bug fixes since parallel update is very hard. That means code are very different on 2
versions. If you are addon developers and confused when upgrading version, join my discord and feel free to ask me.

### Other Minecraft Version?

This mod is planned to be updated to the later Minecraft version after bugs are resolved and some rewrites completed.

I'm not planning to backport the mod, but anyone can do it.

### I cannot find config file

As the config system is based on `Jupiter`, the config will only save needed data. You can change config by using client
side GUI through mod menu. (Requires server operator permission.)

### How to change biome configs

Change biome tags by using datapacks.
